Dear Support Team,

I'm writing to complain about my recent order (#12345) which arrived damaged.
The packaging was torn and several items were missing.

This is very disappointing as I needed these items for an important project.
Please respond ASAP with how you plan to resolve this issue.

Best regards,
John Doe
